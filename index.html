        <p class="bio"> My name is Joonas Uusnäkki.<br> I am 22-year-old student from Espoo.<br>
            Currently I am studying information systems and business at University of Jyväskylä.<br>
            Topics such as producing music, taking aesthetic photos and creating video content are the most
            interesting ones
            for me personally.<br>
            In the future I would like to get better at these things and at the same time learn more about my field
            of
            study,<br>
            such as AI, Internet Of Things and large variety of programming languages.</p>




        <h2><a id="about">About</a></h2>
        <p>I am an university student who aspires to have more knowledge on computer science, business and economics.
            <br>I am
            studying
            at
            University of Jyväskylä with
            information systems and business administration as my major.</p>

        <h2><a id="work">Work experience</a></h2>
        <h4>Communications manager, Member of the Board<br>Dumppi ry<br>January 2020 – December 2020</h4>
        <p>The task includes managing social media accounts, taking care of all the e-mail accounts,
            producing a
            welcome-letter to new students etc.</p>

        <h4>Assistant, Voluntary work overseas<br>Finnish School of Seattle<br>September 2018 – December 2018</h4>
        <p>During my stay at Seattle, WA, I got an opportunity to do some voluntary work at the local
            Finnish
            School,
            which
            is based
            on voluntary work of teachers and parents. The school was arranged two times a week: thursday
            for 6-year
            olds
            and saturday for 10-15 year olds.
            I got to do a large variety of tasks, such as arranging the classes, playing and arranging
            school yard
            games
            and
            activities for the children,
            help the teacher during the meal break, teaching the kids Finnish words and grammar and
            monitor/guide
            small
            tests in the classroom.</p>

        <h4>Substitute teacher<br>City of Espoo<br>January 2018 – September 2019</h4>
        <p>I was given a lot of responsibilities when working for Juvanpuisto school, located at the city of
            Espoo.
            During this time period I had a privilege to teach kids from every agegroup, from ages 8 to 15.
            The experience was priceless because I got to learn how to control, teach, lead and give
            examples in a
            large
            variety of scenarios and classes.</p>

        <h4>Cashier/Warehouseman<br>K-Supermarket Kulinaari<br>May 2018 – September 2018</h4>
        <p>The job included the traditional task of a cashier at the supermarket and the task of a
            warehouseman on
            separate
            workdays.
            As a warehouseman the daily tasks varied greatly compared to the days as cashier: taking care of
            the
            cold
            room
            and the fruit section,
            adding supplements and products to the shelves when they were running low,
            making sure that the carts where in order and in the right place etc.</p>
        <h4>Warehouseman<br>Transval Group<br>April 2016 - August 2016</h4>
        <p>Working in a large storage gave me a broad insight about the logistics of the industry.
            Daily tasks consisted of gathering products from the shelves with a semi-forklift and combining
            them as
            sets,
            which would later be sent to the customers and companies.</p>

        <p>
            As the academic year approaches its end, it would be great to get into a trainee program or land a job this
            summer. In the future
            I see myself working heavily in software development or some sort of IT-consulting. Entrepreunership would
            also be one of my point of interests.
